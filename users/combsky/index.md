Kyle Combs
==============

I pursuing an M.S. in Nuclear Engineering under the guidance of Dr. Todd Palmer. I work as a nuclear fuel perfomance engineer for NuScale Power.

## Research

Our research is primarily focused on showing the value of using Spectral 
Expansion Methods for performing Uncertainty Analysis, as compared to traditional UA methods. We are interested in 
demonstrating the connection between Polynomial Chaos Expansions and Monte Carlo simulation. The dimension and
applicability of this connection is being explored by applying stochastic expansion methods in performing UA 
using multi-physics simulations. UA is important for establishing confidence levels in numerical predictions due to 
the differences which arise between noumenal reality and computer modeled simulations.
